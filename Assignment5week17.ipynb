    "# Key Characteristics:\n",
    "#    1. Ensemble of Decision Trees: Random Forest Regressor builds an ensemble of decision trees during training.\n",
    "#    2. Bootstrap Sampling: Each tree is trained on a random subset of the training data obtained through \n",
    "#bootstrap sampling.\n",
    "#    3. Feature Randomization: Random Forest introduces feature randomization by considering a random subset of\n",
    "#features for each split in each tree.\n",
    "#    4. Aggregation: Predictions from individual trees are aggregated (e.g., by averaging) to obtain the final\n",
    "#regression output.\n",
    "#    5. Robustness: The ensemble approach helps reduce overfitting and improves the model's robustness.\n",
    "\n",

    "# 1. Ensemble of Decision Trees:\n",
    "#    - Random Forest Regressor builds an ensemble of decision trees during training.\n",
    "#    - Each tree is trained on a random subset of the training data through bootstrap sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Bootstrap Sampling:\n",
    "#    - For each tree, a subset of the original dataset is created by randomly sampling with replacement.\n",
    "#    - This introduces diversity among the trees, as each tree sees a slightly different version of the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Feature Randomization:\n",
    "#    - Feature randomization is introduced by considering a random subset of features for each split in each tree.\n",
    "#    - This prevents individual trees from becoming highly specialized to specific features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Aggregation:\n",
    "#    - Predictions from individual trees are aggregated to obtain the final regression output.\n",
    "#    - The ensemble approach helps in reducing the impact of noise and outliers present in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Robustness:\n",
    "#    - By combining multiple trees with different perspectives on the data, Random Forest Regressor becomes more \n",
    "#robust to overfitting.\n",
    "#    - The ensemble smoothens out the predictions, making them less sensitive to variations in individual data points.\n",

    "# 6. Hyperparameters:\n",
    "#    - Hyperparameters such as max_depth, min_samples_split, and min_samples_leaf can be tuned to control the\n",
