    "#Question.2 What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "#Answer.2 Web scraping can be achieved using various methods and techniques, depending on the complexity of the \n",
    "#website and the data to be extracted. Here are some common methods used for web scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Manual Copy-Pasting: The most basic form of web scraping involves manually copying and pasting data from a website\n",
    "#into a spreadsheet or text editor. While it is straightforward, it is not efficient for large-scale data extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Regular Expressions (Regex): Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching in text. They can be used to\n",
    "#extract specific data from web pages by defining patterns that match the desired content. However, regex can become\n",
    "#complex and hard to maintain for more extensive and dynamic web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#HTML Parsing with Libraries: Web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup (for Python) or Cheerio (for Node.js) parse\n",
    "#the HTML structure of web pages, making it easier to extract specific data by navigating the HTML tree. These libraries\n",
    "#simplify the process of locating and extracting desired elements based on tags, classes, or IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#XPath and CSS Selectors: XPath and CSS Selectors are query languages that allow you to specify the elements you want\n",
    "#to extract from an HTML document. They provide more flexibility and control over selecting elements with complex \n",
    "#structures.\n",

    "#APIs: Some websites offer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that provide direct access to their data in a \n",
    "#structured format, making it easier to extract information programmatically without the need for traditional web\n",
    "#scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Headless Browsers: Headless browsers like Puppeteer (for JavaScript) and Selenium (for various programming languages)\n",
    "#simulate real web browsers without a graphical user interface. They allow you to interact with dynamic websites,\n",
    "#execute JavaScript, and extract data from websites that rely heavily on client-side rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Proxy Rotation: To avoid being blocked or to bypass IP rate limits, web scrapers can use rotating proxies. \n",
    "#These proxies change IP addresses periodically, making it harder for websites to detect and block scraping activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Web Scraping Services: There are specialized web scraping services and tools available that handle the entire\n",
    "#scraping process for you. They manage IP rotation, handle CAPTCHAs, and provide data in a structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Web Scraping Frameworks: Some programming languages have dedicated web scraping frameworks that simplify the \n",
    "#process, handling common tasks like downloading web pages, handling cookies, and managing sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Machine Learning-Based Extraction: Advanced techniques involve using machine learning algorithms to recognize \n",
    "#and extract specific data patterns from web pages, especially when the website structure changes frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#It's important to note that while web scraping can be a powerful tool for data collection, it should be done \n",
    "#ethically and responsibly, adhering to the terms of service of the websites being scraped and avoiding overloading\n",
    "#their servers with excessive requests."
