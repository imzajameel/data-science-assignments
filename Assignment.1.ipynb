    "#Question.1 : Describe the decision tree classifier algorithm and how it works to make predictions.\n",
    "#Answer.1 :  The decision tree classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both \n",
    "#classification and regression tasks. It's a tree-like model where each internal node represents a \n",
    "#decision based on the value of a specific feature, each branch represents an outcome of that decision,\n",
    "#and each leaf node represents the final predicted class label or numerical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Here's a step-by-step overview of how the decision tree classifier works:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Selecting the Best Feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "#The algorithm begins at the root node, where the entire dataset is considered.\n",
    "#It evaluates different features to find the one that best separates the data into distinct classes or reduces\n",

    "#Splitting the Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "#The chosen feature is used to split the dataset into subsets based on its values.\n",
    "#Each subset represents a branch stemming from the current node.\n",
    "#Recursive Process:\n",

    "#Leaf Nodes and Class Labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "#When a stopping condition is met, a leaf node is created.\n",
    "#The majority class or the mean value of the target variable in that leaf node is assigned as the predicted class or value.\n",

    "#Decision trees are prone to overfitting, capturing noise in the data.\n",
    "#Techniques like pruning (removing branches) or setting constraints on tree depth help prevent overfitting.\n",
