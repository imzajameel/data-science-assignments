    "#Answer.1 : Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both techniques used to transform categorical data into numerical \n",
    "#format. However, they are used in different scenarios and have distinct characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "#Ordinal encoding is used when there is a clear ordinal relationship between the categories of a categorical \n",
    "#variable. An ordinal relationship implies that the categories have a meaningful order or ranking. In ordinal encoding, \n",
    "#each category is assigned an integer value based on its order.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "#Consider a dataset with a \"Education Level\" feature containing categories like \"High School,\" \"Associate's Degree,\" \n",
    "#\"Bachelor's Degree,\" \"Master's Degree,\" and \"Ph.D.\" Since there is an inherent order in these categories, you \n",
    "#can use ordinal encoding to assign numerical values according to their rank (e.g., 1 for \"High School,\" 2 for \n",
    "#\"Associate's Degree,\" and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "#Label Encoding:\n",
    "#Label encoding is used when the categorical variable does not have a meaningful ordinal relationship, and you simply\n",
    "#want to assign a unique integer to each category. Each category is assigned a different integer, starting from 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "#Imagine a dataset with a \"Gender\" feature containing categories \"Male\" and \"Female.\" Since there is no inherent \n",
    "#order between these categories, you can use label encoding to assign 0 to \"Male\" and 1 to \"Female.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#Choosing Between Ordinal and Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "#You would choose between ordinal and label encoding based on the nature of the categorical variable and the\n",
    "#relationships among its categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "#If the categorical variable exhibits an ordinal relationship, meaning that the categories have a specific order\n",
    "#or rank, ordinal encoding would be suitable. This ensures that the encoded values capture the order of the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#If the categorical variable lacks a meaningful order or ranking, or if you want to avoid introducing any\n",
    "#unintended ordinal relationships, label encoding would be a better choice. It assigns unique integers to\n",
    "#each category without implying any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "#In summary, the primary difference between ordinal encoding and label encoding lies in whether there's\n",
    "#an ordinal relationship among the categories. Always consider the characteristics of your categorical \n",
    "#data and the goals of your analysis when deciding which encoding technique to use."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#Sort Categories by Mean Target Value: Sort the categories based on their mean target values in ascending or\n",

    "\n",
    "#Assign Ordinal Labels: Assign ordinal labels to the sorted categories based on their order. Categories with \n",
    "#higher mean target values receive higher ordinal labels, indicating a higher likelihood of the target variable being true.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Encode the Categorical Variable: Replace the original categorical values with the assigned ordinal labels.\n",

    "#\"High School,\" \"Associate's Degree,\" \"Bachelor's Degree,\" \"Master's Degree,\" and \"Ph.D.\" You want to encode this variable\n",
    "#using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Here's how you might implement it using Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "#import pandas as pd\n",

    "# Sample data\n",

    "\n",
    "# Create a mapping dictionary with ordinal labels\n",
    "#ordinal_mapping = {education: label for label, education in enumerate(education_means.index)}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Apply target guided ordinal encoding\n",
    "#data['Education_encoded'] = data['Education'].map(ordinal_mapping)\n",
    "\n",
    "#print(data)\n",
    "#In this example, \"target_variable\" represents the actual target variable you're trying to predict. The ordinal labels \n",
    "#are assigned based on the mean target values of each education level. Higher mean target values result in higher ordinal\n",
    "#labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Usage Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "#You might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding when you have a categorical variable with an ordinal relationship, and you\n",
    "#believe that the categories' impact on the target variable is essential for the predictive power of your model. This\n",
    "#technique can capture the trends in the data and allow your machine learning model to leverage the information about\n",
