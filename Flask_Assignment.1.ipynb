    "#Flask Assignment.1 \n",
    "#Question.1 : What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "#Answer.1 : Flask is a micro web framework for Python, designed to make it easy to build web applications\n",
    "#quickly and with minimal boilerplate code. It is classified as a micro framework because it provides only \n",
    "#the essential tools for building a web application, leaving developers with the flexibility to choose additional \n",
    "#libraries and tools based on their specific project requirements. Flask follows the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)\n",
    "#standard and can be used with various web servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Minimalistic and Lightweight: Flask is designed to be simple and lightweight, making it easy for developers to\n",
    "#understand and work with. It doesn't impose a lot of structure on your application, giving you the freedom to \n",
    "#organize your code the way you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Flexibility: Being a micro framework, Flask provides just the basic tools for building a web application.\n",
    "#This allows you to choose the components you need and integrate them seamlessly into your project, giving \n",
    "#you greater control over the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Easy to Get Started: Flask's simple and intuitive API makes it easy for both beginners and experienced\n",
    "#developers to get started quickly. You can create a basic web application with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Extensible: While Flask itself is minimal, it is highly extensible. You can easily add various extensions\n",
    "#to your Flask application to add functionality such as database integration, authentication, caching, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Wide Range of Libraries: Flask integrates well with other Python libraries and tools. This means you can leverage \n",
    "#the extensive Python ecosystem for various tasks, such as data manipulation, machine learning, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Built-in Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server, which is convenient for testing and \n",
    "#debugging your application during development without needing to configure a separate web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Great for Small to Medium-sized Applications: Flask is particularly well-suited for building small to medium-sized\n",
    "#web applications, RESTful APIs, and prototypes where a full-fledged framework might be overkill.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Community and Documentation: Flask has a strong and supportive community that provides a wealth of resources,\n",
    "#including documentation, tutorials, and third-party extensions. This makes it easier to find solutions to\n",
    "#common problems and learn how to use the framework effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Jinja2 Templating: Flask uses the Jinja2 template engine, which enables you to separate the presentation layer\n",
    "#from the business logic of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#URL Routing: Flask includes a powerful URL routing mechanism that allows you to map URLs to specific view functions,\n",
    "#making it easy to organize your application's routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#It's important to note that while Flask offers numerous advantages, it might not be the best fit for every project.\n",
    "#For larger applications with complex requirements, a more feature-rich framework like Django might be a better choice. \n",
    "#Flask's strength lies in its simplicity, flexibility, and ability to rapidly develop smaller-scale applications."

    "#Question.3 : What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "#Answer.3 : App routing in Flask refers to the process of defining URL routes for different parts\n",
    "#of your web application. Routes determine how the application responds to different URLs that users\n",
    "#enter in their browsers. In Flask, you use the @app.route() decorator to associate a URL with a Python\n",
    "#function. When a user accesses a specific URL, Flask maps that URL to the corresponding function, which\n",
    "#generates the appropriate response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Reasons why we use app routes in Flask : \n",
    "\n",
    "#URL Structure: App routes allow you to define the structure of your application's URLs. You can create\n",
    "#clean and meaningful URLs that reflect the different sections and functionalities of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Organization: By defining routes, you organize your application's functionality into distinct views.\n",
    "#This separation of concerns makes your codebase more maintainable and easier to navigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Modular Development: Flask routes encourage modular development. You can create separate view functions \n",
    "#for different parts of your application, making it easier to collaborate with other developers and manage changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Dynamic Content: Routes can include placeholders for dynamic content in the URL. For instance, you can\n",
    "#define a route like /user/<username> to handle profiles for different users dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#RESTful APIs: If you're building a RESTful API, app routes help define the endpoints and actions available to \n",
    "#clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "#HTTP Methods: Flask routes can be associated with specific HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.). This enables you \n",
    "#to handle different types of requests differently, allowing you to create more complex interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Readable Code: Using app routes with meaningful function names makes your code more readable. \n",
    "#Other developers can easily understand which functions correspond to specific URL paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Flexibility: Routes allow you to map URLs to arbitrary Python functions, giving you the flexibility \n",
    "#to generate responses based on your application's logic."
