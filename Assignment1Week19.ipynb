    "\n",
    "# K-Means is a popular partitioning clustering algorithm that separates a dataset into K clusters.\n",
    "# The goal is to minimize the sum of squared distances between data points and their assigned cluster centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Steps:\n",
    "# 1. Choose the number of clusters (K) that you want to identify in the dataset.\n",
    "# 2. Initialize K centroids randomly or using a specific strategy.\n",
    "# 3. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming K clusters.\n",
    "# 4. Recalculate the centroids as the mean of data points in each cluster.\n",
    "# 5. Repeat steps 3-4 until convergence or a specified number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Concepts:\n",
    "# - Centroids: Representative points in the feature space that define the center of each cluster.\n",
    "# - Assignment: Associating each data point with the nearest centroid.\n",
    "# - Update: Recalculating centroids based on the mean of data points in each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "# K-Means is sensitive to the initial placement of centroids, and the algorithm may converge to different solutions.\n",
    "# To mitigate this, multiple initializations and the selection of the best solution based on the lowest sum of \n",
    "#squared distances can be employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Limitations:\n",
    "# - Assumes clusters are spherical and equally sized.\n",
    "# - Sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "# - Requires the number of clusters (K) to be specified.\n",
