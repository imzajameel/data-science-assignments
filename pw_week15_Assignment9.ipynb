    "\n",
    "# 1. **Understand the Problem:**\n",
    "#    - Consider the nature of the problem and the business goals.\n",
    "#    - Different problems may prioritize different aspects of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Class Distribution:**\n",
    "#    - Check for class imbalance in the dataset.\n",

    "# 3. **Number of Classes:**\n",
    "#    - Binary classification has two classes (positive and negative).\n",
    "#    - Multiclass classification has three or more classes.\n",

    "# 4. **Decision Boundaries:**\n",
    "#    - In binary classification, there is a single decision boundary that separates the two classes.\n",
    "#    - In multiclass classification, there are multiple decision boundaries, each separating one class from the rest.\n",

    "# 5. **Model Output:**\n",
    "#    - In binary classification, the model typically outputs a probability or score for the positive class, and the\n",

    "#    - Binary classification uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.\n",
