    "\n",
    "#Random Sampling: The samples drawn from the population must be truly random. This \n",

    "#in the sample, and the selection of one individual should not influence the selection\n",

    "\n",
    "#Sample Size: While the Central Limit Theorem does not specify a specific sample size, \n",

    "#larger sample sizes might be needed for the CLT to be effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Finite Variance: The population distribution should have a finite variance\n",

    "#Population Distribution Shape: The Central Limit Theorem is more effective when the shape \n",
