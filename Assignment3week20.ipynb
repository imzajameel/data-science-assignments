    "\n",
    "# 1. **Assumption of Stationarity:**\n",
    "#    - Limitation: Many time series models, including ARIMA, assume stationarity (constant mean and variance). \n",
    "#Real-world data often exhibit non-stationary behavior.\n",
    "#    - Example: In financial markets, stock prices may show trends and volatility changes over time, violating \n",
    "#the stationarity assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Sensitivity to Outliers:**\n",
    "#    - Limitation: Time series analysis can be sensitive to outliers, leading to biased model estimates and inaccurate\n",
    "#forecasts.\n",
    "#    - Example: In healthcare data, an unexpected spike in patient admissions due to a rare event may influence the \n",
    "#model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Inability to Capture Complex Patterns:**\n",
    "#    - Limitation: Traditional time series models may struggle to capture complex patterns or irregularities in the data.\n",
    "#    - Example: In demand forecasting for a retail store, sudden changes in consumer preferences or external factors\n",
    "#may challenge the model's ability to adapt.\n",

    "#    - Limitation: Linear models in time series analysis may not effectively capture non-linear relationships present\n",

    "#    - Example: In climate data, where temperature variations may follow non-linear patterns, linear time series models\n",
    "#may provide inaccurate predictions.\n",

    "#models may struggle to provide reliable forecasts.\n",
